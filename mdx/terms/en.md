  this contract, even if we knew, or should have known or been advised
  of such damages, including lost, damaged, or delayed baggage

As a passenger, you must act in a manner consistent with the safety of
all people on board. This includes compliance with the laws and travel

  security duties, whether federal, airport, or airline staff.

Failure to comply with the passengers\' responsibilities constitutes a
material breach of this contract.

**Your ticket**

Each passenger must have a valid ticket to fly. A ticket is not
transferable; It cannot be used by or refunded to another passenger.

If the ticket has not been used, you must start travel within 1 year
from the date it was issued. If the ticket has been partially used, you
must complete the trip within 1 year from the first completed flight.

Tickets are only valid for travel if used in accordance with all terms
and conditions of sale. Airline ticket coupons must be used in the
sequence specified on the ticket.

Holiday Air fares are non-refundable; however, depending on the
respective fare provisions in force at the time of issuance of the
ticket or the acquisition of an Elite Club membership, your ticket can
be modified with validity of up to 1 year. Please note that, at the time
of making the new reservation, we will make a new calculation of the
applicable fare, based on the requested itinerary change. If the
originally reserved price category is not available for the modified
itinerary, said calculation will be made based on the lowest price
category available on the aforementioned date for your modified
itinerary.

Your ticket is only valid when:

- The trip has as its origin or destination the cities that appear on
  your ticket and in your travel record

- Complies with all tariff requirements.

Your ticket is not valid when:

- It does not meet the requirements of minimum stay, purpose or
  condition of the fare

- We found out that the ticket was purchased through abusive practices

- Prohibited booking methods: Reservations made for the purpose of
  misusing fares or circumventing fare and ticket rules are strictly
  prohibited (for example, combining two or more round-trip fares in
  order to circumvent minimum stay requirements)

If we find evidence that you or your agent are engaging in abusive
practices, we reserve the right to cancel any unused portion of the
ticket and/or deny flight and baggage check-in to the passenger and/or
refuse to refund a ticket that otherwise would have been refundable
and/or charge you the amount equivalent to what the ticket would have
cost if you had not booked it fraudulently and/or request the return of
any compensation that we may have provided.

**Confidentiality**

We process your personal data in accordance with all relevant data
privacy regulations and only for the following purposes: making flight
reservations, purchasing tickets, obtaining additional services,
developing and providing services, facilitating immigration and entry
procedures; as well as make the information associated with the
organization of your trip available to the relevant government agencies
and other airlines, or other providers of the aforementioned services.

**Prepare to fly**

- When it comes to checking in and arriving at the airport, it is best
  to do it in advance. If you are checking in luggage, consider even
  more time.

- Before heading to the airport, you can check which travel alerts are
  in effect for the cities on your itinerary and check flight status
  information, such as boarding times and gates.

- You can check-in online 24 hours before departure. All airports have
  minimum check-in hours. If check-in has not been completed within
  the minimum period, we may reassign your seat to another passenger.

- Seat assignment during check-in is random. Free seat selection will
  only be enabled for those passengers who purchase an Elite Club
  membership, once the ticket is issued.

- On our flights, you must check-in at least 60 minutes before the
  scheduled flight departure. At some airports, it is mandatory to
  check-in further in advance.

- You must be at the gate and ready to board the plane at least 45
  minutes before departure. You must have a boarding pass with a valid
  seat assignment and an ID to board the aircraft.

- Boarding ends 15 minutes before departure. If you have not boarded
  by that time, we can reassign your seat to another passenger. Once
  the doors are closed, you will not be allowed to board.

Sometimes we have to make adjustments to our operations and, in the
interval between the day you make your reservation and the day of
departure, changes may occur to:

- Your flight number

- The type of aircraft you fly on and the services available

- Your seat assignment

- The airline that operates your flight

- The number of stops or transfer cities

- Departure and arrival times

When changes or cancellations affect your travel, we will try to contact
you in advance and allocate you to another flight or a similar seat,
although we cannot guarantee this will be the case.

We do our best to be punctual, but our flight schedule is not guaranteed
and is not part of this contract. We will not take any responsibility
if:

- We are late or you cannot make your connection

- We change the schedule of any flight

- We cancel a flight or route

- Your checked baggage arrives late (except as required by statute,
  regulation, or convention)

- Special, incidental, or consequential damages occur due to these
  changes.

old must be accompanied in the same cabin by a parent, of any age, or by
a person at least 18 years old.

Children (over 2 years old, up to and including 11 years old)

Children ages 2 and up must have a seat purchased. If your child turns 2
during the trip, you must purchase a ticket with a confirmed seat for
the entire route.

[Unaccompanied minor service]{.underline}

Children under 8 years old cannot travel alone.

Minor children, from 8 years to 14 years old, as well as young people
traveling alone, between 15 and 17 years old, obligatorily require the
service for unaccompanied minors.

Contact with a guardian and escort to the boarding gate is required.

Our service for unaccompanied minors ensures that the minor is escorted
to the plane, presented to a flight attendant and handed over to the
authorized person upon arrival at their destination. Please note that
our flight attendants will be busy with their on-board duties and cannot
monitor the child all the time during the flight. Inform your children
that they can use the call button if they need anything.

The charge for unaccompanied minors is USD 175 each way, in addition to
the applicable fare.

the moment you have your ticket, both at the airport and on board, when
there are delays, cancellations and diversions.

If your flight is canceled or there is a delay causing you to miss your
connection, we will reserve you a place on the next Holiday Air flight
with available seats. We will reserve your place in the class or cabin

none were available, we will refund the remaining value of the ticket in

carry-on baggage that we believe is unsuitable for transportation due to
size, weight or nature.

Before you head to the airport, be sure to check out our webpage for
information on all of our checked and carry-on baggage policies.

You can only check luggage on the same day of travel and your luggage
must travel to the last destination indicated on your ticket. Make sure
your name is on all pieces of luggage before checking it in.

your luggage more than 4 hours before departure.

membership category Elite Club Holiday Air. Baggage fees are
non-refundable and apply to each person, each way. Additional fees may
apply for overweight or oversized bags and special items.

Please do not misplace your baggage claim tag as you may need to show it
to collect your baggage. The airport baggage office will only deliver
the baggage to the person with the corresponding baggage tag.

When you arrive in the US on an international flight, you will collect
your checked luggage before clearing customs.

If you arrive with Holiday Air at your final destination and your
luggage has not arrived with you, our goal is to get it to you within 48
hours. Reasons why it may take us longer to get your luggage to you
include:

- We do not know your name, address, or local telephone number.

- You are on a cruise, camping in a remote location, or somewhere
  where we cannot contact you by reasonable means.

- Your delivery address has changed.

- The flights we have to your destination are limited.

- Weather conditions or other operational issues interfere.

Your carry-on bag must fit into the airport size gauge.

The personal item must fit under the front seat.

All luggage must be stowed before takeoff.

Diaper bags, child safety seats or strollers do not count as personal or
carry-on items. Strollers must be checked in at the counters. If you are
traveling with medical and mobility devices, please check with Holiday
Air in advance.

In all cases, we reserve the right to decide whether your hand luggage
is suitable to take on board and whether there is sufficient space in
the overhead bins.

If you need to check your hand luggage, make sure you bring any fragile
or valuable items, such as keys, medicines or computers, on board. In
addition, you must carry on board, and not check in, electronic
cigarettes and spare batteries for laptops, cameras, or other mobile
devices.

Certain fares, aircraft and airports have additional restrictions
regarding carry-on baggage.

We may have to check your luggage at the gate if the overhead bins are
full or if there are restrictions. The size of overhead bins varies and
some aircraft have smaller bins.

**Restricted items**

For the safety of everyone on board, the TSA and Air Force restrict some
common items on airplanes. Make sure you know what you can bring in the
cabin and what you can check in with your luggage before you go to the
airport.

[Dangerous materials]{.underline}

We do not transport hazardous materials, except for small amounts of dry
ice. We can remove and dispose of any hazardous materials in your
luggage.

[Firearms]{.underline}

You can travel with firearms only in checked luggage. Firearms must be
declared to our agents during check-in.

Other temporary rules or policies may apply. Make sure you understand
the rules before you go to the airport.
