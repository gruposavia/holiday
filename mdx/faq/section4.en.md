If you are planning to travel with an infant (under 2 years old) or a child (aged 2 to 11), it is essential to keep in mind the following guidelines to ensure a comfortable and safe trip:

- **Travel with Infants (under 2 years old):**

Babies under 2 years of age do not have the right to a seat and will travel on the lap of a parent or a responsible adult during the flight.

You may carry a personal item with the necessary baby care elements, such as diapers, milk, a bottle. You may also transport a folding stroller.

- **Travel with Children (from 2 to 11 years old):**

Children from 2 to 11 years old will occupy a seat and must pay 75% of the adult rate.

It is recommended to request a special children's menu to satisfy their dietary needs during the flight.

Before travelling, it is important to review the required documentation, such as the child's birth certificate, current passport, valid visa if traveling to the United States, and any required permits.

Additionally, we recommend you to contact our Customer Service Department by e-mail: **[reservation@holidayair.net](mailto:reservation@holidayair.net)** for specific information on the requirements and procedures related to children's travel, thus ensuring that the flight experience is as smooth and enjoyable as possible for you and your family. We are committed to providing a service that fulfils the needs of all our passengers, including the little ones!
