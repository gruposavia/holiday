- **Requirements to Request the Service:**

You can request the service at our sales offices or by calling the Contact Center (+1)786-673-0640 or by e-mail: **[reservation@holidayair.net](mailto:reservation@holidayair.net)**, at the time of booking or up to 48 hours before your flight departure.

Same restriction applies for pets travelling in cabin: bookings must be made and confirmed at least 48 hours before departure. The service is subject to the availability of space on the plane.

- **Special Considerations:**

It is important to take into account your petsâ€™ health entry restrictions to some countries. It is recommended to contact the Health Authority or Consulate of the destination country to obtain updated information.

- **Specific Restrictions for the United States:**

As of July 14, 2021, the CDC restricts the entry of dogs from countries with a high risk of rabies transmission. These restrictions apply to dogs in cabin, assistance dogs and dogs in hold, regardless of their breed.

There are exceptions for dogs coming from high-risk rabies countries if they meet certain requirements.

It is important to carefully review the requirements and conditions before planning a trip with your pet. We're here to assist you and provide a safe and comfortable travel experience for both you and your furry companion!
