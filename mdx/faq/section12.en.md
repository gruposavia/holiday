If for any reason you forgot an object on the plane, we inform you the steps to follow to facilitate the recovery of your belongings:

- **Immediate Communication:**

As soon as you realize that you have forgotten something on the plane, please contact our Holiday Air staff at the airport, before leaving the terminal.

- **Forgotten Object Record:**

Our team will record and document any forgotten items. This record will include details such as the object's description, flight number, and the date and time it was found.

- **Retention Period:**

We will store forgotten items, whether personal items or luggage, for a period of 2 months from the date they were found.

- **Claim and Recovery:**

To recover your belongings, contact our Lost & Found Service as soon as possible. We will provide assistance to coordinate the recovery of your lost items.

- **Retention Conditions:**

It is important to keep in mind that some objects, especially those that are perishable or for personal use such as medicines and food, may have specific retention conditions that vary by country and local regulations.

- **Destruction of Unclaimed Objects:**

After the 2-month retention period has passed, if no one has claimed the forgotten items, they will be submitted to destruction. Perishable and personal use items will be discarded immediately.

We urge you to contact our L&F team as soon as possible to increase your chances of recovering your belongings. Our goal is to facilitate this process and provide you with the best possible assistance in recovering forgotten items.
