Our planes do not have individual screens or chargers for electronic devices. However, we are pleased to inform you that we have implemented on-board high-speed Wi-Fi service and in-flight entertainment to enhance your flight experience.

We strongly recommend you to check and ensure you carry an extra battery for your electronic devices before the flight, as we do not provide chargers on board. Our on-board Wi-Fi offers the opportunity to access a variety of online content during the flight, including entertainment, news and other web-based services.
